We used the following third party library to implement the observer pattern:
"RxJS" used in "employee.service.ts" and "popup.service.ts"

Discrepancies between wireframe and project:
We implemented an additional functionality for our delete process.
Just like when an employee is created, the website displays a toast that indicates the user operation was successful.
We chose to use this behaviour for our delete process as well.
